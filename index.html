                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Clear History:</strong>
                    <p>Using the Clear History button, users can delete all previous translations from the history. The app prompts the user for confirmation to avoid accidental deletion. Upon confirmation, the history list is cleared and a status message is shown.</p>
                </li>
                
                <li><strong>Application Status Display (Status Strip):</strong>
                    <p>A Status Strip at the bottom of the application shows the current status in a Status Label. The app updates the Status Label when a new process begins (e.g., "Translating...") or completes ("Translation Complete"), keeping users informed of the app's status at all times.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        
            <h4>Additional User Experience Enhancements:</h4>
            <ul>

            <h3>Intrusion Detection System</h3>
            <img src="IDS.png" alt="IDS Image" class="project-image">
            <p>This project is a real-time Intrusion Detection System that monitors network traffic, detects suspicious activities, and provides detailed reports.</p>
        
            <h4>Project Overview:</h4>
            <p>The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) project is designed to provide real-time monitoring and detection of potential threats within network traffic. The project uses machine learning for anomaly detection, captures and analyzes network packets for specific types of suspicious activity, and offers a detailed reporting system in PDF format with graphical summaries of threats detected over time. This IDS is suitable for environments where network security is a priority and provides IT teams with a tool for proactive threat detection.</p>
        
            <h4>Functionalities:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Network Packet Capture and Analysis:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Through the use of the <code>scapy</code> library, this system captures network packets in real-time and analyzes them to identify suspicious activities such as brute-force attempts and port scans.</li>
                        <li>The function <code>analyze_packet()</code> inspects each incoming packet's IP and TCP layers to detect unusual patterns, such as multiple connection attempts (potential brute-force) or specific flags in packets indicating port scanning.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
        
                <li><strong>Anomaly Detection with Machine Learning:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>This IDS employs an Isolation Forest model from <code>scikit-learn</code> to detect anomalies in network traffic based on specific packet parameters, including IP, payload size, and port number.</li>
